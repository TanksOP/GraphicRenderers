# Graphics
This was a University project where I created different types of renderers in C++. First I created the scene in Maya as a base, to make sure it looked the same throughout the different renderers. The first renderer uses the PBRT render system and adds in my scene to see how PBRT would render it. I then created a rasterizer and a raytracer to render the same scene. The scene was inspired by a photo from Garreth Paul, linked in the references. 

To have a look at the code for the renderers go into the finalwork/code folder, the different renderers are split into their own folders with code for them.
